- âœ… /api/openai/chat
  - Streaming response implementation
  - Error handling for API key issues
- âœ… /api/openai/transcribe
  - Handles audio file processing
  - Temporary file management
- âœ… /api/anthropic/chat
  - Streaming implementation
  - Uses latest Claude model
- âœ… /api/replicate/generate-image
  - Stable Diffusion integration
  - Image dimension controls
- âœ… /api/deepgram
  - Real-time transcription support
  - Client-side implementation

## Technical Debt
- Implement proper test coverage
- Add error boundary components
- Consider implementing rate limiting
- Add proper TypeScript types for all API responses
- Consider implementing a caching layer

## In Progress
- ðŸŸ¡ Slide export functionality (PDF, PNG, PPTX)
  - Research started on html-to-image library
  - Considering pptxgenjs for PowerPoint export
- ðŸŸ¡ Enhanced error handling and recovery
  - Basic retry logic implemented
  - Need to add circuit breakers
- ðŸŸ¡ Performance optimizations
  - Initial logging implemented
  - Need to add performance metrics

## Next Steps
1. Implement slide export functionality
   - Add export options for different formats
   - Ensure proper styling in exports
   - Handle export errors gracefully
   - Consider using html-to-image for PNG export
   - Evaluate pptxgenjs for PPTX generation

2. Enhance error handling
   - Add retry mechanisms for failed API calls
   - Implement graceful degradation
   - Improve error messages and recovery options
   - Add circuit breaker pattern for API calls

3. Optimize performance
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Optimize API calls and data processing
   - Add loading skeletons for better UX
   - Consider implementing React Suspense

4. Add testing
   - Unit tests for services
   - Integration tests for API routes
   - End-to-end tests for critical flows
   - Add Jest and React Testing Library

## Known Issues
- None currently - OpenAI API key configuration issue has been resolved
- Previous issues:
  - âœ… Fixed: OpenAI API key format (project-scoped keys now supported)
  - âœ… Fixed: Edge runtime conflicts (switched to Node.js runtime)

## Recent Updates
- Fixed OpenAI API key configuration to support project-scoped keys
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Implemented proper error handling for API routes
- Switched all API routes to Node.js runtime

## Environment Setup
- Required environment variables:
  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-*****
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-*****
  REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=r8_*****
  DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=****
  ```
- Node.js version: 18.x or higher
- Next.js version: 14.x
- All API routes using Node.js runtime

## Git Configuration
- Repository: https://github.com/feligrosso/testing_tcv.git
- Working directory: C:\Users\pipeg\OneDrive\Desktop\v2a consulting app\template-2
- Current branch: main
- Remote setup:
  ```bash
  git remote set-url origin https://github.com/feligrosso/testing_tcv.git
  ```
- Git commands from the correct directory:
